        <h1>The Earth Simulator Supercomputer</h1>
        <p>The Earth Simulator was a supercomputer developed by Japan in 2002 and was designed to create a virtual twin of the planet
            for climate modeling and other simulations.
        </p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The main purpose was to run realistic models and holistic simulations of Earth's climate. This included the oceans and the
            atmosphere with a 10 km resolution. It was used for weather forecasting, environmental change analysis, and earthquake 
            pattern analysis.
        </p>
        <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            The original Earth Simulator was a parallel vector supercomputer with 640 processor nodes each containing 8 vector processors.
            Which caused it to be the fastest supercomputer of the time almost 5 times faster than the supercomputer that came before it 
            the ASCI White.
